I'm a 3rd year PhD student in the computer science department of [Purdue University](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/).
I'm fortunate to be advised by [Prof. David F. Gleich](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dgleich/). 
Prior to coming to Purdue, I obtained my Master of Science degree in computer science from [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/),
where I worked with [Prof. Richard Peng](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~yangp/) and [Prof. Diyi Yang](https://cs.stanford.edu/~diyiy/).
Before that I got my bachelor's degree from [Dalian University of Technology](https://en.dlut.edu.cn/).

I'm broadly interested in graph algorithms, network science, matrix computations.

When not doing research, I enjoy rock climbing, running and hiking. I used to do some competitive programming([codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/yyyyyyffffff)).
